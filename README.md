# generator-composer-ionic

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Jakeeyturner/composer-ionic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Jakeeyturner/composer-ionic)

The composer-ionic code generation tool produces [Ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/framework) hybrid mobile applications, that can interact with blockchains using the [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest) framework.


## Running the mobile application code generation tool

1. [Install Hyperledger Composer pre-requisites](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/installing-prereqs.html)


2. [Install Hyperledger Composer development environment](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/development-tools.html)


3. Install the Composer-Ionic code generation tool using the command: `npm install -g generator-composer-ionic`


4. Run the code generation tool using the command: `yo composer-ionic`


5. Generated mobile applications can be run in a browser debug mode, by changing into the directory and running the command: `npm start`


6. Native platform binaries can be built and run on devices using [Apache Cordova](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/#using-cordova)
